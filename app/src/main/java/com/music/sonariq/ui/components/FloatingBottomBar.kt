 * spring rather than as a material. This settles on the second approach — one
 * soft pass beyond the mark and done — which is the difference between bouncy

 * end. Driven off how far there is still to go, so it is widest in the middle
 * of the trip and exactly itself once it arrives — no state to keep, and it
 * falls out of a drag for free, since dragging is nothing but a long way still
